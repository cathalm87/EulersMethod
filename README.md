Eulers method


Euler’s method is a numerical method that you can use to approximate the solution to an initial value problem with a 
differential equation that can’t be solved using a more traditional method, like the methods we use to solve separable, 
exact, or linear differential equations.

As part of a larger project that I am working on I needed to calculate differential equations using a numerical method that could be 
used in Java. The solution: Euler's Method.
